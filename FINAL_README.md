This was a very difficult challenge for me. I got the hang of it by the end, but I needed a lot of help from Svitlana and the TA's. 
Figuring out the cells(i,1).value <> cells(i+1).value was a key insight into solving the challenge. I'll admit that, while the code to populate the other columns makes
sense to me, I'm still not totally clear on the Total_Volume code. It's also not completely correct. It's summing the stock volumes, but the final value is different than
the example in GitLab and I can't figure out where it's not correct. I referenced the Credit Card exercise from VBA Activites on Day 3, asked Joe, and asked the tutor...and
it all seems like it should be correct. I am wide open to assistance on where I'm going wrong. 

I attached the three screenshots of the data from 2014, 2015, and 2016, as requested. I also included my code in a txt file. Please let me know if this is not complete or if you
need this in some other format. (The Excel workbook was too large to upload.)

Coding VBA seems like it's mostly a matter of naming the cells and keeping track of what the new name is as the code chugs along and the values for the named cells update.
